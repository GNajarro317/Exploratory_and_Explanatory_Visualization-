### Project Title
Exploratory and Explanatory Visualization

### Description
In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis on a San Francisco bike-sharing dataset. I used Python libraries to examine univariate and multivariate relationships, asking questions about data structure and patterns. The goal was to uncover insights into how demographics influence trip duration, time, and location.

Steps Taken
* Data Introduction: Briefly described the dataset and my key questions.
* Preliminary Wrangling: Cleaned the data and identified features for analysis.
* Data Exploration:
    * Univariate: Created histograms and count plots.
    * Bivariate: Developed scatter and box plots, as well as heatmaps.
    * Multivariate: Generated facet plots and scatter plots with multiple encodings.

### Explanatory Analysis
I summarized my findings using polished visualizations, focusing on key insights and maintaining design integrity.
